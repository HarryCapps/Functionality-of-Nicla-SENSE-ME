This GitHub repository contains the code used in a research project for CHEM501 - Digital Alchemy: Synthesising Code and Chemistry at the University of Liverpool.


# Description 

Hi! Weâ€™re Harry and Ben, and this is our CHEM501 project exploring the overall functionality of the NICLA Sense ME. The investigation will take place across two seperate buildings within the university of liverpool (Central Teaching Hub and Sydney Jones library). For us to investigate the potential of the Nicla Sense ME, we decided to look into the BSEC sensor - a digital indoor air quality sensor with the ability to detect pressure, humidity, temperature, CO2 concentrations, VOC concentrations all within an accuracy index measurement. We will use this sensor to detect how good the BSEC is at detecting the IAQ with a related accuracy reading and how valid this index is. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensor was also used as a measurement of detection for devices in a certain area to give an indication to 'busyness'. Finally the last sensor we were intrigued by was the Gyroscope, this was measured and detected via hand movements.
